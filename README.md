# Exploring Textual Data through Interactive Visualizations

## Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing the Cornell Movie Dialogs Dataset. The goal is to explore and process the dataset using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and present the findings through interactive web-based visualizations. The project encompasses data exploration, web integration, and sophisticated visualizations with a focus on interactivity and user engagement.

## Dataset

The Cornell Movie Dialogs Dataset contains a rich collection of movie scripts and dialogues. It includes:

- **Movie Titles**: The name of the movie.
- **Character Names**: Names of the characters involved in the dialogues.
- **Dialogues**: Actual lines spoken by characters.
- **Metadata**: Additional information about the movies and dialogues.

## Requirements

### 1. Data Exploration

Utilize Python and NLP libraries such as NLTK to perform the following tasks:

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify and categorize entities in the dialogues (e.g., people, locations, organizations).
- **Basic NLP Tasks**: Tokenization, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and sentiment analysis.

### 2. Web Integration

Implement a backend using Flask or Django to transfer the processed data from Python to the web interface. The backend should handle data requests and serve processed data to the frontend for visualization.

### 3. Interactive Visualizations

Develop a web-based interface using D3.js that includes:

- **Visualization Variety**: Create at least two sophisticated visualizations, avoiding standard charts. Visualizations should be interactive with features such as highlighting, selection, and zooming.
- **Graph/Tree Visualization**: Include one visualization that represents data in graph or tree format.
- **Focus+Context Style**: Implement the visualizations in a Focus+Context style to provide a clear view of details while maintaining overall context.

### 4. Brushing and Linking (Dashboarding)

Implement brushing and linking functionalities to allow interactions between visualizations. This feature should enhance the exploration and understanding of the dataset.
